# FriendFinder

This application allows you to fill out a 10 question survey about how you feel towards certain food scenerios.
After submiting your survey, you are then directed to a compatible page. This page will load "Foodies" 
(profiles of people preloaded into the program) that you are most like.

In the survery you can add a name and picture. Currently the picture is not saved on a local server so you will have to add an image url of yourself or any picture from a google image.




To start the program you will need to do an NPM install of:

"body-parser",

"express",

"inquirer",

"path"


Next you will need to go to your terminal and type "node server.js"
once that is running check out your local server and have fun with Foodie Finder!
